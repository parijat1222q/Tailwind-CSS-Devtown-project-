# Personal Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website built using only HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Fully responsive layout
- Four main sections: Home, About, Projects, Contact
- Hover effects, smooth scrolling
- Clean and modern UI using Tailwind utility classes

## Experience
Building this helped me understand Tailwind's utility-first approach and practice structuring semantic HTML with responsive layouts.
